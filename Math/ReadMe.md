<em>Here you will find a program package that uses mainly mathematical processing.</em>

<ul>

  <li><h4> Quotient.py : </h4> </li><hr>
  
  <p>Quotient.py is a program that reviews the multiplication tables of a number passed as a parameter of a function.</p>

  <p>It performs the tables of this number up to a number designated by the second parameter of the function.</p>

  <p>It handles the exceptions of type ValueError.</p>

  <p>Use the modQuotient.py file to start the program.</p>

  <hr>
  
  
  
  <li><h4> FizzBuzz.py : </h4> </li><hr>
  
  <p>FizzBuzz is a very well known little program that involves determining if a number is divisible by X, Y or X and Y at the same time.</p>

  <p>You can determine the maximum number until the program will attempt a division by X or Y.</p>

  <p>Each occurrence is kept in an Array.</p>

  <p>Only ValueError exceptions are processed.</p>
  
  <p>The main mechanics of the program is the modulo operator.</p>
