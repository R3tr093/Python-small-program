<p><em>Crytpo is a character chain treatment program.</em></p>

<p>We review each character of the chain, it is assigned according to its value a new value.</p>

<p>In this way we encrypt the message enter by the user, we proceed by a binary logic on the basis that a is 0.</p>

<p>We can both encrypt a message, and decrypt it with a loop that allows us to define which option we want to use.</p>

<p><strong>example.py starts the program through a module (crypto.py)</strong></p>
