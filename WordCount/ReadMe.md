<hr>

<p>WordCount is a very simple program that contains a function taking as parameter a string.</p>

<p>It then returns the number of characters contained in this same string.</p>

<p>example.py uses the program by invoking a module.</p>

<p> This is one of the first I designed, it is very simple and very short. </p>
